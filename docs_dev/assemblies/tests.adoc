== Test suite information

The adoption docs repository also includes a test suite for Adoption.
There are targets in the Makefile which can be used to execute the
test suite:

* `test-minimal` - a minimal test scenario, the eventual set of
services in this scenario should be the "core" services needed to
launch a VM. This scenario assumes local storage backend for
services like Glance and Cinder.
* `test-with-ceph` - like 'minimal' but with Ceph storage backend for
Glance and Cinder.

== Configuring the test suite

* Create `tests/vars.yaml` and `tests/secrets.yaml` by copying the
included samples (`tests/vars.sample.yaml`,
`tests/secrets.sample.yaml`).
* Walk through the `tests/vars.yaml` and `tests/secrets.yaml` files
and see if you need to edit any values. If you are using the
documented development environment, majority of the defaults should
work out of the box. The comments in the YAML files will guide you
regarding the expected values. You may want to double check that
these variables suit your environment:
 ** `install_yamls_path`
 ** `controller*_ssh`       (for each {OpenStackPreviousInstaller} controller in each Heat stack on the source cloud)
 ** `tripleo_passwords`     (for each {OpenStackPreviousInstaller} Heat stack on the source cloud)
 ** `source_galera_members` (for each cell controller on the source cloud)
 ** `source_mariadb_ip`     (for each cell controller on the source cloud)
 ** `edpm_privatekey_path`
 ** `timesync_ntp_servers`

== Running the tests

The interface between the execution infrastructure and the test suite
is an Ansible inventory and variables files. Inventory and variable
samples are provided. To run the tests, follow this procedure:

* Install dependencies and create a venv:
+
[,bash]
----
sudo dnf -y install python-devel
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install openstackclient osc_placement jmespath
ansible-galaxy collection install community.general
----

* Run `make test-with-ceph` (the documented development environment
does include Ceph).
+
If you are using Ceph-less environment, you should run `make
test-minimal`.

== Making patches to the test suite

Please be aware of the following when changing the test suite:

* The test suite should follow the docs as much as possible.
+
The purpose of the test suite is to verify what the user would run
if they were following the docs. We don't want to loosely rewrite
the docs into Ansible code following Ansible best practices. We want
to test the exact same bash commands/snippets that are written in
the docs. This often means that we should be using the `shell`
module and do a verbatim copy/paste from docs, instead of using the
best Ansible module for the task at hand.
