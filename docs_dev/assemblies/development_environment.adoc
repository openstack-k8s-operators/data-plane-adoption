= Development environment

The Adoption development environment utilizes
https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/install_yamls[install_yamls]
for CRC VM creation and for creation of the VM that hosts the source
OSP 17.1 OpenStack in Standalone configuration.

== Preparing the host

== Deploying CRC

[WARNING]
If you want to deploy using IPv6, our current way of deploying a
lightweight OCP environment is with Single Node Openshift (SNO) instead of CRC.
See section at the bottom of the page for IPv6 development environment
deployment.

=== CRC environment for virtual workloads

=== CRC environment with Openstack Ironic

[IMPORTANT]
This section is specific to deploying Nova with Ironic backend. Skip
it if you want to deploy Nova normally.

Create the BMaaS network (`crc-bmaas`) and virtual baremetal nodes controlled by
a RedFish BMC emulator.

'''

== Deploying TripleO Standalone

Use the https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/install_yamls/tree/main/devsetup[install_yamls devsetup]
to create a virtual machine (edpm-compute-0) connected to the isolated networks.

[IMPORTANT]
To use OSP 17.1 content to deploy TripleO Standalone, follow the
https://url.corp.redhat.com/devel-rhoso-adoption[guide for setting up downstream content]
for `make standalone`.

=== Snapshot/revert

When the deployment of the Standalone OpenStack is finished, it's a
good time to snapshot the machine, so that multiple Adoption attempts
can be done without having to deploy from scratch.

[,bash]
----
cd ~/install_yamls/devsetup
make standalone_snapshot
----

And when you wish to revert the Standalone deployment to the
snapshotted state:

[,bash]
----
cd ~/install_yamls/devsetup
make standalone_revert
----

Similar snapshot could be done for the CRC virtual machine, but the
developer environment reset on CRC side can be done sufficiently via
the install_yamls `*_cleanup` targets. This is further detailed in
the section:
https://openstack-k8s-operators.github.io/data-plane-adoption/dev/#_reset_the_environment_to_pre_adoption_state[Reset the environment to pre-adoption state]

'''

== Network routing

Route VLAN20 to have access to the MariaDB cluster:

[,bash]
----
EDPM_BRIDGE=$(sudo virsh dumpxml edpm-compute-0 | grep -oP "(?<=bridge=').*(?=')")
sudo ip link add link $EDPM_BRIDGE name vlan20 type vlan id 20
sudo ip addr add dev vlan20 172.17.0.222/24
sudo ip link set up dev vlan20
----

To adopt the Swift service as well, route VLAN23 to have access to the storage
backend services:

[,bash]
----
EDPM_BRIDGE=$(sudo virsh dumpxml edpm-compute-0 | grep -oP "(?<=bridge=').*(?=')")
sudo ip link add link $EDPM_BRIDGE name vlan23 type vlan id 23
sudo ip addr add dev vlan23 172.20.0.222/24
sudo ip link set up dev vlan23
----

'''

== Creating a workload to adopt

To run `openstack` commands from the host without
installing the package and copying the configuration file from the virtual machine, create an alias:

[,bash]
----
alias openstack="ssh -i ~/install_yamls/out/edpm/ansibleee-ssh-key-id_rsa root@192.168.122.100 OS_CLOUD=standalone openstack"
----

=== Virtual machine steps

Create a test VM instance with a test volume attachement:

[,bash]
----
cd ~/data-plane-adoption
export CINDER_VOLUME_BACKEND_CONFIGURED=true <1>
export CINDER_BACKUP_BACKEND_CONFIGURED=true
export OPENSTACK_COMMAND="ssh -i ~/install_yamls/out/edpm/ansibleee-ssh-key-id_rsa root@192.168.122.100 OS_CLOUD=standalone openstack"
OS_CLOUD_IP=192.168.122.100 OS_CLOUD_NAME=standalone \
    bash tests/roles/development_environment/files/pre_launch.bash
----
<1> Use `CINDER_*_BACKEND_CONFIGURED=false`, if Cinder Volume or Backup services' storage backends have been not configured for the source cloud,
or won't be configured for the target cloud. That might be a valid case for some developement setups, but not for a production scenarios.

This also creates a test Cinder volume, a backup from it, and a snapshot of it.

Create a Barbican secret:

```
openstack secret store --name testSecret --payload 'TestPayload'
```

If using Ceph backend, confirm the image UUID can be seen in Ceph's
images pool:

[,bash]
----
ssh -i ~/install_yamls/out/edpm/ansibleee-ssh-key-id_rsa root@192.168.122.100 sudo cephadm shell -- rbd -p images ls -l

https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/openstack-operator/blob/main/config/samples/core_v1beta1_openstackcontrolplane_network_isolation_ceph.yaml

oc apply -f /tmp/core_v1beta1_openstackcontrolplane_network_isolation_ceph.yaml
----

A NG control plane which uses the same Ceph backend should now be
functional. If you create a test image on the NG system to confirm
it works from the configuration above, be sure to read the warning
in the next section.

Before beginning adoption testing or development you may wish to
deploy an EDPM node as described in the following section.

=== Warning about two OpenStacks and one Ceph

Though workloads can be created in the NG deployment to test, be
careful not to confuse them with workloads from the Wallaby cluster
to be migrated. The following scenario is now possible.

A Glance image exists on the Wallaby OpenStack to be adopted.

[,bash]
----
[stack@standalone standalone]$ export OS_CLOUD=standalone
[stack@standalone standalone]$ openstack image list
+--------------------------------------+--------+--------+
| ID                                   | Name   | Status |
+--------------------------------------+--------+--------+
| 33a43519-a960-4cd0-a593-eca56ee553aa | cirros | active |
+--------------------------------------+--------+--------+
[stack@standalone standalone]$
----

If you now create an image with the NG cluster, then a Glance image
will exsit on the NG OpenStack which will adopt the workloads of the
wallaby.

[,bash]
----
[fultonj@hamfast ng]$ export OS_CLOUD=default
[fultonj@hamfast ng]$ export OS_PASSWORD=12345678
[fultonj@hamfast ng]$ openstack image list
+--------------------------------------+--------+--------+
| ID                                   | Name   | Status |

+--------------------------------------+--------+--------+
[fultonj@hamfast ng]$
----

Both Glance images are stored in the same Ceph pool.

----

However, as far as each Glance service is concerned each has one
image. Thus, in order to avoid confusion during adoption the test
Glance image on the NG OpenStack should be deleted.

[,bash]
----
openstack image delete 4ebccb29-193b-4d52-9ffd-034d440e073c
----

Connecting the NG OpenStack to the existing Ceph cluster is part of
the adoption procedure so that the data migration can be minimized
but understand the implications of the above example.

=== Deploy edpm-compute-1

edpm-compute-0 is not available as a standard EDPM system to be
managed by https://openstack-k8s-operators.github.io/edpm-ansible[edpm-ansible]
or
https://openstack-k8s-operators.github.io/openstack-operator/dataplane[openstack-operator]
because it hosts the wallaby deployment which will be adopted
and after adoption it will only host the Ceph server.

Use the https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/install_yamls/tree/main/devsetup[install_yamls devsetup]
to create additional virtual machines and be sure
that the `EDPM_COMPUTE_SUFFIX` is set to `1` or greater.
Do not set `EDPM_COMPUTE_SUFFIX` to `0` or you could delete
the Wallaby system created in the previous section.

When deploying EDPM nodes add an `extraMounts` like the following in
the `OpenStackDataPlaneNodeSet` CR `nodeTemplate` so that they will be
configured to use the same Ceph cluster.

[,bash]
----
    edpm-compute:
      nodeTemplate:
        extraMounts:
        - extraVolType: Ceph
          volumes:
          - name: ceph
            secret:
              secretName: ceph-conf-files
          mounts:
          - name: ceph
            mountPath: "/etc/ceph"
            readOnly: true
----

A NG data plane which uses the same Ceph backend should now be
functional. Be careful about not confusing new workloads to test the
NG OpenStack with the Wallaby OpenStack as described in the previous
section.

=== Begin Adoption Testing or Development

We should now have:

* An NG glance service based on Antelope running on CRC
* An TripleO-deployed glance serviced running on edpm-compute-0
* Both services have the same Ceph backend
* Each service has their own independent database

An environment above is assumed to be available in the
https://openstack-k8s-operators.github.io/data-plane-adoption/user/#adopting-the-image-service_adopt-control-plane[Glance Adoption documentation]. You
may now follow other Data Plane Adoption procedures described in the
https://openstack-k8s-operators.github.io/data-plane-adoption[documentation].
The same pattern can be applied to other services.

== Deploying an IPv6 environment

In order to perform an adoption with IPv6, we will need an Openshift node (SNO
instead of CRC in this case), an IPv6 control plane Openstack environment, and
some extra settings we will see through this section.

=== IPv6 Lab

As a prerequisite, make sure you have `systemd-resolved` configured for DNS
resolution.

[,bash]
----
dnf install -y systemd-resolved
systemctl enable --now systemd-resolved
ln -sf ../run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf
----

We should also have Virtualization Tools installed (`libvirt` and `qemu`), and
the username you are going to use added to the `libvirt` and `qemu` group.

[,bash]
----
sudo usermod -a -G libvirt,qemu <username>
----

Furthermore, you should have an RSA key generated to use as identification to
access your SNO, and your pull secret stored on your user folder.

If you did not have libvirt installed, there is a chance that you don't have a
default pool defined in libvirt. If that is the case, you can define it with
the following commands

[,bash]
----
cat > /tmp/default-pool.xml <<EOF
<pool type='dir'>
  <name>default</name>
  <target>
    <path>/var/lib/libvirt/images</path>
    <permissions>
      <mode>0711</mode>
      <owner>0</owner>
      <group>0</group>
      <label>system_u:object_r:virt_image_t:s0</label>
    </permissions>
  </target>
</pool>
EOF
sudo virsh pool-define  default-pool.xml
sudo virsh pool-start default
----

Once all the prerequisites are present, you can go ahead and use the `install_yamls`
repository to install the IPv6Lab from the `devsetup` folder. Steps are taken from the
https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/install_yamls/tree/main/devsetup[install_yamls devsetup README]:

[,bash]
----
cd install_yamls/devsetup
export NETWORK_ISOLATION_NET_NAME=net-iso
export NETWORK_ISOLATION_IPV4=false
export NETWORK_ISOLATION_IPV6=true
export NETWORK_ISOLATION_INSTANCE_NAME=sno
export NETWORK_ISOLATION_IP_ADDRESS=fd00:aaaa::10
export NNCP_INTERFACE=enp7s0

make download_tools
make ipv6_lab # Set up the needed networking setup (NAT64 bridge)

make network_isolation_bridge # Create the network-isolation network

make attach_default_interface # Attach the network-isolation bridge to SNO
----

To be able to access the SNO lab you need to source the SNO environment. After that you will be able to use `oc` commands:

[,bash]
----
source /home/<user>/.ipv6lab/sno_env
oc login -u admin -p 12345678 https://api.sno.lab.example.com:6443
----
You can also ssh the SNO for debugging purposes:
[,bash]
----
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa core@fd00:aaaa::10
----

[NOTE]
If you find any problems on the nat64 router you can connect via SSH with `fedora@fd00:abcd:abcd:fc00::2` or the SNO installation via `core@fd00:abcd:abcd:fc00::11`

=== Deploying TripleO Standalone with IPv6

[WARNING]
There is still no official setup, but in this https://github.com/karelyatin/install_yamls/commit/8151634183fe1302383a98e0e9f0779b68232ad6[fork of install_yamls]
there is a commit that can be used in order to deploy it successfully.

=== IPv6 Network routing

First, we need to know which bridge we will use for EDPM.

----
sudo virsh dumpxml edpm-compute-0 | grep -oP "(?<=bridge=').*(?=')"

When searching for bridges on the compute you might see more than one. This is
because one is meant to have all the network isolation `net-iso` and the other
one is `nat64`, for external routing. In ipv4 environment we would only have
one.


Route VLAN20 to have access to the MariaDB cluster:

[,bash]
----
sudo ip link add link $EDPM_BRIDGE name vlan20 type vlan id 20
sudo ip addr add dev vlan20 fd00:bbbb::222/64
sudo ip link set up dev vlan20
----

To adopt the Swift service as well, route VLAN23 to have access to the storage backend services:

[,bash]
----
sudo ip link add link $EDPM_BRIDGE name vlan23 type vlan id 23
sudo ip addr add dev vlan23 fd00:dede::222/64
sudo ip link set up dev vlan23
----

[WARNING]

If you want to test your adoption using FIPs you will need to add IPv4 routing
to your IPv6 environment. This is achieved by adding an IPv4 address from the
192.168.122.0/24 range to br-ctlplane in the standalone and another one to
net-iso in the host. You also need to configure correctly the routes in both.

In order to be able to use floating IPs, this an example of how configuration
could look.

On the hypervisor host:
[,bash]
----
ip addr add 192.168.122.3/24 dev net-iso
ip a show net-iso
# Output
9: net-iso: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 52:54:00:f9:af:e4 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 192.168.122.3/24 scope global net-iso
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 fd00:aaaa::1/64 scope global
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 fe80::5054:ff:fef9:afe4/64 scope link
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

sudo ip route del 192.168.122.0/24 dev virbr0
ip route
# Output
<other routes>
...
192.168.122.0/24 dev net-iso proto kernel scope link src 192.168.122.3
----

On the standalone:
[,bash]
----
ip addr add 192.168.122.4/24 dev net-iso
ip a show br-ctlplane
# Output
5: br-ctlplane: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN g
roup default qlen 1000
    link/ether 52:54:00:46:72:c6 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 192.168.122.4/24 scope global br-ctlplane
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 fd00:aaaa::99/128 scope global
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 fd00:aaaa::100/64 scope global
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 fe80::5054:ff:fe46:72c6/64 scope link
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

ip route
# Output
192.168.122.0/24 dev br-ctlplane proto kernel scope link src 192.168.122.4

=== Further steps

From here, the steps should be similar to the IPv4 adoption. Note that every
command that requires access to the standalone VM via SSH (i.e. when creating a workload) should be done using
a different address:

[,bash]
----
OS_CLOUD_IP=fd00:aaaa::100 OS_CLOUD_NAME=standalone \
    bash tests/roles/development_environment/files/pre_launch.bash
----

And, when installing operators, use:
[,bash]
----
scp -6 -i ~/install_yamls/out/edpm/ansibleee-ssh-key-id_rsa root@[fd00:aaaa::100]:/root/tripleo-standalone-passwords.yaml ~/
