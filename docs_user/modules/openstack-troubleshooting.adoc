and how to solve them.

== ErrImagePull due to missing authentication

The deployed containers pull the images from private containers registries that
can potentially return authentication errors like:

----
Failed to pull image "registry.redhat.io/rhosp-rhel9/openstack-rabbitmq:17.0":
rpc error: code = Unknown desc = unable to retrieve auth token: invalid
username/password: unauthorized: Please login to the Red Hat Registry using
your Customer Portal credentials.
----

An example of a failed pod:

----
  Normal   Scheduled       3m40s                  default-scheduler  Successfully assigned openstack/rabbitmq-server-0 to worker0
  Normal   AddedInterface  3m38s                  multus             Add eth0 [10.101.0.41/23] from ovn-kubernetes

----

To solve this issue you need a valid pull-secret from the official https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret[Red
Hat console site],
store this pull secret locally in a machine with access to the Kubernetes API
(service node), and then run:

----
oc set data secret/pull-secret -n openshift-config --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=<pull_secret_location.json>
----

The previous command will make available the authentication information in all
the cluster's compute nodes, then trigger a new pod deployment to pull the
container image with:

----
kubectl delete pod rabbitmq-server-0
----

And the pod should be able to pull the image successfully.  For more
information about what container registries requires what type of
authentication, check the https://access.redhat.com/RegistryAuthentication[official
docs].
