= TLS Everywhere

Note: The assumption is, that the new deployment will adopt the settings from the
old deployment, so in case TLS Everywhere is disabled, it won't be enabled on
the new deployment.

If the Director deployment was deployed with TLS Everywhere, FreeIPA (IdM) is used
to issue certificates for the OpenStack services. Certmonger, a client process which
is installed on all hosts, interacts with FreeIPA (IdM) to request, install, track
and renew these certificates.

The new Operator based deployment uses the cert-manager operator to issue, track
and renew the certificates.

Because the same root CA is used to generate new certificates, the currently used chain
of trust doesn't have to be modified.
