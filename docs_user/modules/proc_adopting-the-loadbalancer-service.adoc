= Adopting the {loadbalancer_service}

During the adoption process the {loadbalancer_first_ref} service
must stay disabled in the new control plane.

== Certificates
Before running the script below the shell variables `CONTROLLER1_SSH` and
`CONTROLLER1_SCP` must be set to contain the command to log into one of the
controllers using `ssh` and `scp` respectively as root user as shown below.

[source,bash]
----
$ CONTROLLER1_SSH="ssh -i <path to the ssh key> root@192.168.122.100"
$ CONTROLLER1_SCP="scp -i <path to the ssh key> root@192.168.122.100"
----

Make sure to replace `<path to the ssh key>` with the correct path to the ssh
key for connecting to the controller.

[source,bash]
----
include::../../tests/roles/dataplane_adoption/tasks/octavia_certs.yaml[lines="7..83",indent=0]
----

These commands convert the existing single CA configuration into a dual CA configuration.

// == TODO: Other things

== Final steps
Octavia services must remain disabled until data plane adoption is finished in
order to avoid amphora failovers before the data plane adoption steps were
finished.
