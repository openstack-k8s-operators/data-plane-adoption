= Service configurations

There is a fundamental difference between the director and operator deployments
regarding the configuration of the services.

In director deployments many of the service configurations are abstracted by
director-specific configuration options. A single director option may trigger
changes for multiple services and support for drivers, for example, the Block Storage service (cinder), that
require patches to the director code base.

In operator deployments this approach has changed: reduce the installer specific knowledge and leverage OpenShift and
OpenStack service specific knowledge whenever possible.

To this effect OpenStack services will have sensible defaults for OpenShift
deployments and human operators will provide configuration snippets to provide
necessary configuration, such as the Block Storage service backend configuration, or to override
the defaults.

This shortens the distance between a service specific configuration file (such
as `cinder.conf`) and what the human operator provides in the manifests.

These configuration snippets are passed to the operators in the different
`customServiceConfig` sections available in the manifests, and then they are
layered in the services available in the following levels. To illustrate this,
if you were to set a configuration at the top Block Storage service level (`spec: cinder:
template:`) then it would be applied to all the Block Storage services; for example to
enable debug in all the Block Storage services you would do:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: core.openstack.org/v1beta1
kind: OpenStackControlPlane
metadata:
  name: openstack
spec:
  cinder:
    template:
      customServiceConfig: |
        [DEFAULT]
        debug = True
< . . . >
----

If you only want to set it for one of the Block Storage services, for example the
scheduler, then you use the `cinderScheduler` section instead:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: core.openstack.org/v1beta1
kind: OpenStackControlPlane
metadata:
  name: openstack
spec:
  cinder:
    template:
      cinderScheduler:
        customServiceConfig: |
          [DEFAULT]
          debug = True
< . . . >
----

In OpenShift it is not recommended to store sensitive information like the
credentials to the Block Storage service storage array in the CRs, so most OpenStack operators
have a mechanism to use OpenShift's `Secrets` for sensitive configuration
parameters of the services and then use then by reference in the
`customServiceConfigSecrets` section which is analogous to the
`customServiceConfig`.

The contents of the `Secret` references passed in the
`customServiceConfigSecrets` will have the same format as `customServiceConfig`:
a snippet with the section/s and configuration options.

When there are sensitive information in the service configuration then it
becomes a matter of personal preference whether to store all the configuration
in the `Secret` or only the sensitive parts. However, if you split the
configuration between `Secret` and `customServiceConfig` you still need the
section header (eg: `[DEFAULT]`) to be present in both places.

Attention should be paid to each service's adoption process as they may have
some particularities regarding their configuration.
