[id="adopting-the-compute-service_{context}"]

= Adopting the {compute_service}

To adopt the {compute_service_first_ref}, you patch an existing `OpenStackControlPlane` custom resource (CR) where the {compute_service} is disabled. The patch starts the service with the configuration parameters that are provided by the {rhos_prev_long} ({OpenStackShort}) environment. The following procedure describes a single-cell setup.

//[NOTE]
//The following example scenario describes a single-cell setup. Real
//multi-stack topology that is recommended for production use results in cells having a different database layout, and should use different naming schemes. kgilliga: We might reinstate this note after multi-cell is finished in Feature Release 1.

.Prerequisites

* You have completed the previous adoption steps.
* You have defined the following shell variables. Replace the following example values with the values that are correct for your environment:
----
$ alias openstack="oc exec -t openstackclient -- openstack"
----

.Procedure

. Patch the `OpenStackControlPlane` CR to deploy the {compute_service}:
+
[NOTE]
This procedure assumes that {compute_service} metadata is deployed on the top level and not on each cell level. If the {OpenStackShort} deployment has a per-cell metadata deployment, adjust the following patch as needed. You cannot run the metadata service in `cell0`.

. If you are adopting the {compute_service} with the {bare_metal_first_ref}, append the following `novaComputeTemplates` in the `cell1` section of the {compute_service} CR patch:
+
[source,yaml]
----
        cell1:
          novaComputeTemplates:
            standalone:
              customServiceConfig: |
                [DEFAULT]
                host = <hostname>
                [workarounds]
                disable_compute_service_check_for_ffu=true
----
+
* Replace <hostname> with the hostname of the node that is running the `ironic` Compute driver in the source cloud.

. Wait for the CRs for the Compute control plane services to be ready:
+
----
$ oc wait --for condition=Ready --timeout=300s Nova/nova
----
+
[NOTE]
The local Conductor services are started for each cell, while the superconductor runs in `cell0`.
Note that `disable_compute_service_check_for_ffu` is mandatory for all imported Compute services until the external data plane is imported, and until Compute services are fast-forward upgraded. For more information, see xref:adopting-compute-services-to-the-data-plane_data-plane[Adopting Compute services to the {rhos_acro} data plane] and xref:performing-a-fast-forward-upgrade-on-compute-services_data-plane[Performing a fast-forward upgrade on Compute services].

.Verification

* Check that {compute_service} endpoints are defined and pointing to the
control plane FQDNs, and that the Nova API responds:
+
----
$ openstack endpoint list | grep nova
$ openstack server list
----
+
** Compare the outputs with the topology-specific configuration in xref:proc_retrieving-topology-specific-service-configuration_migrating-databases[Retrieving topology-specific service configuration].

* Query the superconductor to check that `cell1` exists, and compare it to pre-adoption values:
+
----
. ~/.source_cloud_exported_variables
echo $PULL_OPENSTACK_CONFIGURATION_NOVAMANAGE_CELL_MAPPINGS
oc rsh nova-cell0-conductor-0 nova-manage cell_v2 list_cells | grep -F '| cell1 |'
----
+
The following changes are expected:
+
** The `cell1` `nova` database and username become `nova_cell1`.
** The default cell is renamed to `cell1`.
** RabbitMQ transport URL no longer uses `guest`.

[NOTE]
At this point, the {compute_service} control plane services do not control the existing {compute_service} workloads. The control plane manages the data plane only after the data adoption process is completed. For more information, see xref:adopting-compute-services-to-the-data-plane_data-plane[Adopting Compute services to the {rhos_acro} data plane].

[IMPORTANT] 
To import external Compute services to the {rhos_acro} data plane, you must upgrade them first.
For more information, see xref:adopting-compute-services-to-the-data-plane_data-plane[Adopting Compute services to the {rhos_acro} data plane], and xref:performing-a-fast-forward-upgrade-on-compute-services_data-plane[Performing a fast-forward upgrade on Compute services].
