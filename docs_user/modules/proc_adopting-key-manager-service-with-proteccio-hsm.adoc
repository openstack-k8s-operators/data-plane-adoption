= Adopting the {key_manager} with Proteccio HSM integration

[role="_abstract"]
To adopt the {key_manager_first_ref} with Proteccio Hardware Security Module (HSM) integration, you use the enhanced Barbican adoption role with HSM support enabled through a configuration flag. This approach preserves HSM integration while adopting all existing secrets from your source {rhos_prev_long} ({OpenStackShort}) environment.

The {key_manager} Proteccio HSM adoption is complete if you see the following results:

* The `BarbicanAPI` and `BarbicanWorker` services are up and running with HSM-enabled configuration.
* All secrets from the source {OpenStackShort} {rhos_prev_ver} environment are available in {rhos_long} {rhos_curr_ver}.
* The PKCS11 crypto plugin is available alongside `simple_crypto` for new secret storage.
* HSM functionality is verified and operational.

[NOTE]
====
This procedure is specifically for environments that use Proteccio HSM. For standard {key_manager} adoption using `simple_crypto`, see xref:adopting-the-key-manager-service_{context}[Adopting the {key_manager}].

The enhanced Barbican adoption role supports HSM configuration through a simple boolean flag. This approach integrates seamlessly with the standard data-plane-adoption framework while providing HSM support.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have a running {OpenStackPreviousInstaller} environment with Proteccio HSM integration (the source cloud).
* You have a Single Node OpenShift or OpenShift Local running in the {rhocp_long} cluster.
* You have SSH access to the source {OpenStackPreviousInstaller} undercloud and controller nodes.
* You have configured HSM variables in your adoption configuration files.
* The required HSM secrets are created in your target namespace.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The HSM adoption process requires proper configuration of HSM-related variables and secrets. Ensure that:

* HSM login secrets are configured in your target namespace
* HSM client data secrets contain the necessary certificate and configuration files
* All HSM-related variables are properly set in your configuration files

Without proper HSM configuration, your HSM-protected secrets will become inaccessible after adoption.
====

.Procedure

. Configure HSM integration variables in your adoption configuration:
+
----
# Enable HSM integration
barbican_hsm_enabled: true

# Optional: Configure HSM-specific variables (defaults provided)
proteccio_library_path: "/usr/lib64/libnethsm.so"
proteccio_hsm_tokens: ["VHSM1"]
proteccio_mkek_name: "adoption_mkek_1"
proteccio_hmac_name: "adoption_hmac_1"
proteccio_login_password: "your_hsm_password"
----

. Run the Barbican HSM adoption playbook:
+
----
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory.yaml playbooks/barbican_hsm_adoption.yml
----
+
The playbook will:
+
--
* Extract the simple crypto KEK from the source configuration
* Deploy Barbican with HSM-enabled configuration
* Verify HSM functionality
--

.Verification

. Ensure that the {identity_service_first_ref} endpoints are defined and are pointing to the control plane FQDNs:
+
----
$ openstack endpoint list | grep key-manager
----

. Ensure that Barbican API service is registered in the {identity_service}:
+
----
$ openstack service list | grep key-manager
----

. Verify that all secrets from the source environment are available:
+
----
$ openstack secret list
----

. Confirm that Barbican services are running:
+
----
$ oc get pods -n openstack -l service=barbican -o wide
----

. Test secret creation to verify HSM functionality:
+
----
$ openstack secret store --name adoption-verification --payload 'HSM adoption successful'
----

. Verify HSM backend is operational:
+
----
$ openstack secret get <secret-id> --payload
----

.Additional resources

* For troubleshooting adoption issues, check the Ansible playbook logs and OpenShift events.
* To switch the default secret store from `simple_crypto` to `pkcs11` after verifying HSM connectivity:
+
----
$ oc patch openstackcontrolplane openstack -n openstack --type='json' -p='[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/barbican/template/globalDefaultSecretStore", "value": "pkcs11"}]'
----
