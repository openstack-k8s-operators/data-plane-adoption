= Preparing Controller nodes for director Operator adoption

Prepare the Controller nodes in your director Operator (OSPdO) environment for adoption to the {rhos_long} environment.

[NOTE]
====
The following procedure uses a single {rhocp_long} cluster that is shared by the source OSPdO environment and a destination {rhos_acro} environment. Two {OpenShiftShort} master nodes are transferred to the {rhos_acro} environment, leaving OSPdO with one node for the duration of the adoption process. After adoption, the remaining node can be used by the {rhos_acro} environment as well.
====

.Procedure

. Log in to the {OpenShiftShort} environment where {OpenStackShort} OSPdO is deployed and change to the project that hosts your {OpenStackShort} deployment:
+
----
$ oc project openstack
----

. Define the common environment variables:
+
----
export PASSWORD_FILE="tripleo-passwords.yaml"

export RHOSO18_NAMESPACE="rhoso"

export OSPDO_NAMESPACE="openstack"

export OS_CLIENT="oc exec -c openstackclient -t openstackclient -- "

export CONTROLLER_SSH="oc rsh -n $OSPDO_NAMESPACE -c openstackclient openstackclient ssh controller-0.ctlplane"

export CONTROLLER1_SSH="oc -n $OSPDO_NAMESPACE rsh -c openstackclient openstackclient ssh controller-0.ctlplane"
export CONTROLLER2_SSH=
export CONTROLLER3_SSH=

export OSPDO_INTERNAL_API_NET="internalapi"

export STORAGE_CLASS=$(oc get -n $OSPDO_NAMESPACE pvc openstackclient-hosts -o jsonpath='{.spec.storageClassName}')
----

. Get the name of the node where the current {OpenStackShort} Controller virtual machine (VM) is running:
+
----
$ export CONTROLLER_NODE=$(oc -n $OSPDO_NAMESPACE get vmi -ojson | jq -r '.items[0].status.nodeName')
----

. If you are using a combination master/worker cluster with a high availability OSPdO environment, configure OSPdO to use a single {OpenStackShort} Controller node:

.. Disable stonith:
+
----
$ stonith_resources=$($CONTROLLER1_SSH sudo pcs stonith status|grep Started|awk '{print $2}')
for resource in stonith_resources ;do $CONTROLLER1_SSH sudo pcs stonith disable $resource;done
----
.. Put non-Controller nodes in maintenance:
+
----
$CONTROLLER1_SSH sudo pcs node maintenance <controller-1> <controller-2>
----
+
* Replace `<controller-1>` and `<controller-2>` with the names of the Controller nodes in your environment.

.. Update the quorum for single node:
+
----
$CONTROLLER1_SSH sudo systemctl stop corosync
$CONTROLLER2_SSH sudo systemctl stop corosync
$CONTROLLER3_SSH sudo systemctl stop corosync
$CONTROLLER1_SSH sudo pcs quorum update last_man_standing=1 wait_for_all=1
$CONTROLLER1_SSH sudo systemctl restart corosync
----
.. Restart the Pacemaker cluster:
+
----
$CONTROLLER1_SSH sudo pcs cluster stop
$CONTROLLER1_SSH sudo pcs cluster start
----
+
.. Check that only Controller-0 is started and that the other 2 Controllers are stopped:
+
----
$CONTROLLER_SSH sudo pcs status
----
.. Check if the {OpenStackShort} control plane is still operational:
+
----
$OS_CLIENT openstack compute service list
----
+
[NOTE]
You might need to wait a few minutes for the control plane to get operational. The control plane response slows down after this point.
.. When Pacemaker is only managing one of the Controllers, delete 2 of the Controller VMs. The following example specifies Controller-1 and Controller-2 VMs for deletion:
+
----
$ oc -n openstack annotate vm controller-1 osp-director.openstack.org/delete-host=true
$ oc -n openstack annotate vm controller-2 osp-director.openstack.org/delete-host=true
----
.. Reduce the `roleCount` for the Controller role in the `OpenStackControlPlane` CR to `1`:
+
----
$ oc -n openstack patch OpenStackControlPlane overcloud --type json -p '[{"op": "replace", "path":"/spec/virtualMachineRoles/controller/roleCount", "value": 1}]'
----
.. Ensure that the `OpenStackClient` pod is running on the same {OpenShiftShort} nodes as the remaining Controller VM. If the `OpenStackClient` pod is not on the same node, then move it by cordoning off the two nodes that have been freed up for {rhos_acro}. Then you delete the `OpenStackClient` pod so that it gets rescheduled on the {OpenShiftShort} node that has the remaining Controller VM. After the pod is moved to the correct node, uncordon all the nodes:
+
----
$ oc adm cordon $OSP18_NODE1
$ oc adm cordon $OSP18_NODE2
$ oc delete pod openstackclient
$ oc adm uncordon $OSP18_NODE1
$ oc adm uncordon $OSP18_NODE2
----
.. Remove the OSPdO node network configuration policies from the other two nodes that are not running the Controller VM by placing a `nodeSelector` on the {OpenShiftShort} node that contains the Controller VM:
+
----
$ for i in br-ctlplane br-ex br-osp; do oc patch osnetconfig openstacknetconfig --type json -p '[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/attachConfigurations/'$i'/nodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy/nodeSelector", "value": {"kubernetes.io/hostname": "'$CONTROLLER_NODE'"}}]'; done
----
