= Adopting the {image_service} that is deployed with an NFS back end

Adopt the {image_service_first_ref} that you deployed with an NFS back end. To complete the following procedure, ensure that your environment meets the following criteria:

* The Storage network is propagated to the {rhos_prev_long} ({OpenStackShort}) control plane.
* The {image_service} can reach the Storage network and connect to the nfs-server through the port `2049`.

.Prerequisites

* You have completed the previous adoption steps.
* In the source cloud, verify the NFS parameters that the overcloud uses to configure the {image_service} back end. Specifically, in your{OpenStackPreviousInstaller} heat templates, find the following variables that override the default content that is provided by the `glance-nfs.yaml` file in the
`/usr/share/openstack-tripleo-heat-templates/environments/storage` directory:
+
----

**GlanceBackend**: file

**GlanceNfsEnabled**: true

**GlanceNfsShare**: 192.168.24.1:/var/nfs

----
+
[NOTE]
====
In this example, the `GlanceBackend` variable shows that the {image_service} has no notion of an NFS back end. The variable is using the `File` driver and, in the background, the `filesystem_store_datadir`. The `filesystem_store_datadir` is mapped to the export value provided by the `GlanceNfsShare` variable instead of `/var/lib/glance/images/`.
If you do not export the `GlanceNfsShare` through a network that is propagated to the adopted {rhos_long} control plane, you must stop the `nfs-server` and remap the export to the `storage` network. Before doing so, ensure that the {image_service} is stopped in the source Controller nodes.
ifeval::["{build}" != "downstream"]
In the control plane, as per the (https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/docs/blob/main/images/network_diagram.jpg)[network isolation diagram],
the {image_service} is attached to the Storage network, propagated via the associated `NetworkAttachmentsDefinition` custom resource, and the resulting Pods have already the right permissions to handle the {image_service} traffic through this network.
endif::[]

ifeval::["{build}" != "upstream"]
In the control plane, the {image_service} is attached to the Storage network, then propagated through the associated `NetworkAttachmentsDefinition` custom resource (CR), and the resulting pods already have the right permissions to handle the {image_service} traffic through this network.
endif::[]
In a deployed {OpenStackShort} control plane, you can verify that the network mapping matches with what has been deployed in the {OpenStackPreviousInstaller}-based environment by checking both the `NodeNetworkConfigPolicy` (`nncp`) and the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` (`net-attach-def`). The following is an example of the output that you should check in the {rhocp_long} environment to make sure that there are no issues with the propagated networks:

.Procedure

. Adopt the {image_service} and create a new `default` `GlanceAPI` instance that is connected with the existing NFS share:
+
----
$ cat << EOF > glance_nfs_patch.yaml

spec:
  extraMounts:
  - extraVol:
    - extraVolType: Nfs
      mounts:
      - mountPath: /var/lib/glance/images
        name: nfs
      propagation:
      - Glance
      volumes:
      - name: nfs
        nfs:
          path: <exported_path>
          server: <ip_address>
    name: r1
    region: r1
  glance:
    enabled: true
    template:
      databaseInstance: openstack
      customServiceConfig: |
        [DEFAULT]
        enabled_backends = default_backend:file
        [glance_store]
        default_backend = default_backend
        [default_backend]
        filesystem_store_datadir = /var/lib/glance/images/
      storage:
        storageRequest: 10G
      glanceAPIs:
        default:
          replicas: 0
          type: single
          override:
            service:
              internal:
                metadata:
                  annotations:
                    metallb.universe.tf/address-pool: internalapi
                    metallb.universe.tf/allow-shared-ip: internalapi
                    metallb.universe.tf/loadBalancerIPs: 172.17.0.80
                spec:
                  type: LoadBalancer
          networkAttachments:
          - storage

* Replace `<ip_address>` with the IP address that you use to reach the `nfs-server`.
* Replace `<exported_path>` with the exported path in the `nfs-server`.

. Patch the `OpenStackControlPlane` CR to deploy the {image_service} with an NFS back end:
+
----
$ oc patch openstackcontrolplane openstack --type=merge --patch-file glance_nfs_patch.yaml
----

.Verification

* When `GlanceAPI` is active, confirm that you can see a single API instance:
+
----
$ oc get pods -l service=glance
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS
glance-default-single-0   3/3     Running   0
```
----

* Ensure that the description of the pod reports the following output:
+
----
Mounts:
...
  nfs:
    Type:      NFS (an NFS mount that lasts the lifetime of a pod)
    Server:    {{ server ip address }}
    Path:      {{ nfs export path }}
    ReadOnly:  false
...
----

* Check that the mountpoint that points to `/var/lib/glance/images` is mapped to the expected `nfs server ip` and `nfs path` that you defined in the new default `GlanceAPI` instance:
+
----
$ oc rsh -c glance-api glance-default-single-0

sh-5.1# mount
...
...
{{ ip address }}:/var/nfs on /var/lib/glance/images type nfs4 (rw,relatime,vers=4.2,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,namlen=255,hard,proto=tcp,timeo=600,retrans=2,sec=sys,clientaddr=172.18.0.5,local_lock=none,addr=172.18.0.5)
...
...
----

* Confirm that the UUID is created in the exported directory on the NFS node. For example:
+
----
$ oc rsh openstackclient
$ openstack image list

sh-5.1$  curl -L -o /tmp/cirros-0.5.2-x86_64-disk.img http://download.cirros-cloud.net/0.5.2/cirros-0.5.2-x86_64-disk.img
...
...

sh-5.1$ openstack image create --container-format bare --disk-format raw --file /tmp/cirros-0.5.2-x86_64-disk.img cirros
...
...

sh-5.1$ openstack image list
+--------------------------------------+--------+--------+

| 634482ca-4002-4a6d-b1d5-64502ad02630 | cirros | active |
+--------------------------------------+--------+--------+
----

* On the `nfs-server` node, the same `uuid` is in the exported `/var/nfs`:
+
----
$ ls /var/nfs/
