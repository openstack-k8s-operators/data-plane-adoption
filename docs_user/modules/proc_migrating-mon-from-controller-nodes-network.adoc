= Migrating the Ceph Monitor IP address

[role="_abstract"]
You must migrate your Ceph Monitor IP addresses to the target {Ceph} nodes. The
IP address migration assumes that the target nodes are originally deployed by
{OpenStackPreviousInstaller} and that the network configuration is managed by
`os-net-config`.

// NOTE (fpantano): we need to document the same ip address migration procedure
// w/ an EDPM node that has already been adopted.
.Procedure

. Get the original Ceph Monitor IP addresses from `$HOME/ceph_client_backup/ceph.conf` file on the `mon_host` line, for example:
+
----
mon_host = [v2:172.17.3.60:3300/0,v1:172.17.3.60:6789/0] [v2:172.17.3.29:3300/0,v1:172.17.3.29:6789/0] [v2:172.17.3.53:3300/0,v1:172.17.3.53:6789/0]
----

. Match the IP address retrieved in the previous step with the storage network IP addresses on the source node, and find the Ceph Monitor IP address:
+
----
[tripleo-admin@controller-0 ~]$ ip -o -4 a | grep 172.17.3
9: vlan30    inet 172.17.3.60/24 brd 172.17.3.255 scope global vlan30\       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
9: vlan30    inet 172.17.3.13/32 brd 172.17.3.255 scope global vlan30\       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
----

. Confirm that the Ceph Monitor IP address is present in the `os-net-config` configuration that is located in the `/etc/os-net-config` directory on the source node:
+
----
[tripleo-admin@controller-0 ~]$ grep "172.17.3.60" /etc/os-net-config/config.yaml
    - ip_netmask: 172.17.3.60/24
----

. Edit the `/etc/os-net-config/config.yaml` file and remove the `ip_netmask` line.

. Save the file and refresh the node network configuration:
+
----
$ sudo os-net-config -c /etc/os-net-config/config.yaml
----

. Verify that the IP address is not present in the source node anymore, for example:
+
----
[controller-0]$ ip -o a | grep 172.17.3.60
----

. SSH into the target node, for example `cephstorage-0`, and add the IP address
for the new Ceph Monitor.

. On the target node, edit `/etc/os-net-config/config.yaml` and
add the `- ip_netmask: 172.17.3.60` line that you removed in the source node.

. Save the file and refresh the node network configuration:
+
----
$ sudo os-net-config -c /etc/os-net-config/config.yaml
----

. Verify that the IP address is present in the target node.
+
----
$ ip -o a | grep 172.17.3.60
----

. From the Ceph client node, `controller-0`, ping the IP address that is
  migrated to the target node and confirm that it is still reachable:
+
----
[controller-0]$ ping -c 3 172.17.3.60
----
