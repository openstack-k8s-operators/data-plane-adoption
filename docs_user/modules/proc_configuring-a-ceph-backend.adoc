= Configuring a Ceph backend

If the original deployment uses a Ceph storage backend for any service
(e.g. Glance, Cinder, Nova, Manila), the same backend must be used in the
adopted deployment and custom resources (CRs) must be configured accordingly.

If you use {rhos_component_storage_file_first_ref}, on TripleO environments, the CephFS driver in {rhos_component_storage_file} is configured to use
its own keypair. For convenience, modify the `openstack` user so that you
can use it across all {rhos_prev_long} services.

Using the same user across the services serves two purposes:

* The capabilities of the user required to interact with {rhos_component_storage_file}
became far simpler and hence, more became more secure with {rhos_acro} {rhos_curr_ver}.
* It is simpler to create a common ceph secret (keyring and ceph config
file) and propagate the secret to all services that need it.

[TIP] 
To run `ceph` commands, you must use SSH to connect to a Ceph
storage node and run `sudo cephadm shell`. This brings up a ceph orchestrator
container that allows you to run administrative commands against the ceph
cluster. If you deployed the ceph cluster by using {OpenStackPreviousInstaller}, you may launch the `cephadm` shell from an {OpenStackShort} controller node.

.Prerequisites

* The `OpenStackControlPlane` custom resource (CR) must already exist.
* Define the following shell variables. The values are illustrative. Use values that are correct for your environment:

.Procedure

. Create the `ceph-conf-files` secret, containing Ceph configuration:
+
----
oc apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
data:
  ceph.client.openstack.keyring: $CEPH_KEY
  ceph.conf: $CEPH_CONF
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: ceph-conf-files
  namespace: openstack
type: Opaque
EOF
----
+
The content of the file should look something like this:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: ceph-conf-files
  namespace: openstack
stringData:
  ceph.client.openstack.keyring: |
    [client.openstack]
        key = <secret key>
        caps mgr = "allow *"
        caps mon = "allow r, profile rbd"
        caps osd = "pool=vms, profile rbd pool=volumes, profile rbd pool=images, allow rw pool manila_data'
  ceph.conf: |
    [global]
    fsid = 7a1719e8-9c59-49e2-ae2b-d7eb08c695d4
    mon_host = 10.1.1.2,10.1.1.3,10.1.1.4
----

. Configure `extraMounts` within the `OpenStackControlPlane` CR:
+
[source,yaml]
----
oc patch openstackcontrolplane openstack --type=merge --patch '
spec:
  extraMounts:
    - name: v1
      region: r1
      extraVol:
        - propagation:
          - CinderVolume
          - CinderBackup
          - GlanceAPI
          - ManilaShare
          extraVolType: Ceph
          volumes:
          - name: ceph
            projected:
              sources:
              - secret:
                  name: ceph-conf-files
          mounts:
          - name: ceph
            mountPath: "/etc/ceph"
            readOnly: true
