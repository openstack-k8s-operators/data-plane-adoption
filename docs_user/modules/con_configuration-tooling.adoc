develop to compare the configuration files between the TripleO deployment and
the next gen cloud.
Make sure Golang is installed and configured on your env:

----

pushd os-diff
make build

[source,yaml]

    IdentitiesOnly yes

Host virthost
    Hostname virthost
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    User root
    StrictHostKeyChecking no
    UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null


Host standalone
    Hostname standalone
ifeval::["{build}" != "downstream"]
    IdentityFile ~/install_yamls/out/edpm/ansibleee-ssh-key-id_rsa
endif::[]
ifeval::["{build}" == "downstream"]
    IdentityFile *<path to SSH key>*
endif::[]
    User root
    StrictHostKeyChecking no
    UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null

Host crc
    Hostname crc
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    User stack
    StrictHostKeyChecking no
    UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null
