= Troubleshooting the {object_storage_first_ref} migration

You can troubleshoot issues with the {object_storage_first_ref} migration.

* The following command might be helpful to debug if the replication is not working and the `swift-dispersion-report` is not back to 100% availability.

CONTROLLER1_SSH tail /var/log/containers/swift/swift.log | grep object-server

This should show the replicator progress, for example:

* You can also check the ring consistency and replicator status:
+
----
oc debug --keep-labels=true job/swift-ring-rebalance -- /bin/sh -c 'swift-ring-tool get && swift-recon -r --md5'
----
+
Note that the output might show a md5 mismatch until approx. 2 minutes after pushing new rings. Eventually it looks similar to the following example:
