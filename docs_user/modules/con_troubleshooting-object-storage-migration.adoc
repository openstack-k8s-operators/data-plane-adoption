= Troubleshooting the {object_storage} migration

You can troubleshoot issues with the {object_storage_first_ref} migration.

* If the replication is not working and the `swift-dispersion-report` is not back to 100% availability, check the replicator progress to help you debug:
+
----
$ CONTROLLER1_SSH tail /var/log/containers/swift/swift.log | grep object-server
----
+
The following shows an example of the output:

* You can also check the ring consistency and replicator status:
+
----
$ oc debug --keep-labels=true job/swift-ring-rebalance -- /bin/sh -c 'swift-ring-tool get && swift-recon -r --md5'
----
+
The output might show a md5 mismatch until approximately 2 minutes after pushing the new rings. After the 2 minutes, the output looks similar to the following example:
