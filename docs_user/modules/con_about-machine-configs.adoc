= About machine configs 

Some services require you to have services or kernel modules running on the hosts where they run, for example `iscsid` or `multipathd` daemons, or the
`nvme-fabrics` kernel module.

For those cases you use `MachineConfig` manifests, and if you are restricting
the nodes that you are placing the OpenStack services on using the `nodeSelector` then
you also want to limit where the `MachineConfig` is applied.

To define where the `MachineConfig` can be applied, you need to use a
`MachineConfigPool` that links the `MachineConfig` to the nodes.

For example to be able to limit `MachineConfig` to the 3 OpenShift nodes that you
marked with the `type: openstack` label, you create the
`MachineConfigPool` like this:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfigPool
metadata:
  name: openstack
spec:
  machineConfigSelector:
    matchLabels:
      machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: openstack
  nodeSelector:
    matchLabels:
      type: openstack
----

And then you use it in the `MachineConfig`:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfig
metadata:
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: openstack
< . . . >
----

Refer to the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.13/post_installation_configuration/machine-configuration-tasks.html[OpenShift documentation for additional information on `MachineConfig` and `MachineConfigPools`]

*WARNING:* Applying a `MachineConfig` to an OpenShift node will make the node
reboot.
