= Key Manager service support for crypto plug-ins

[role="_abstract"]
The Key Manager service (barbican) supports multiple crypto plug-ins for different security requirements and deployment scenarios.

== Supported crypto plug-ins

The following crypto plug-ins are supported in {rhos_acro}:

* **Simple Crypto Plugin**: Software-based cryptographic backend suitable for development and testing environments
* **PKCS#11 Plugin**: Hardware Security Module (HSM) integration for production environments requiring enhanced security

//*TODO: Talk about Ceph Storage and Swift Storage nodes, HCI deployments,
//etc.*

For environments that require HSM integration during adoption, see xref:adopting-key-manager-service-with-proteccio-hsm_{context}[Adopting the {key_manager} with Proteccio HSM integration].

== HSM Integration

The Key Manager service supports Hardware Security Module (HSM) integration through the PKCS#11 plugin. This enables:

* Enhanced security for secret storage and retrieval
* Hardware-based key management
* Compliance with security requirements for production environments
* Preservation of existing HSM-protected secrets during adoption

HSM integration is configured through a simple boolean flag (`barbican_hsm_enabled`) during the adoption process.
