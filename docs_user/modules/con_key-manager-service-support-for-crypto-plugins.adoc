= Key Manager service support for crypto plug-ins

The Key Manager service (barbican) does not yet support all of the crypto plug-ins available in {OpenStackPreviousInstaller}.

//**TODO: Right now Barbican only supports the simple crypto plugin.

//*TODO: Talk about Ceph Storage and Swift Storage nodes, HCI deployments,
//etc.*
