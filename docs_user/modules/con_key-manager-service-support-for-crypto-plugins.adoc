= Key Manager service support for crypto plug-ins

[role="_abstract"]
The {key_manager_first_ref} supports multiple crypto plug-ins for different security requirements and deployment scenarios.

The following crypto plug-ins are supported in {rhos_long}:

* Simple Crypto Plug-in: Software-based cryptographic back end suitable for development and testing environments
* Public Key Cryptography Standard  (PKCS) #11 Plug-in: Hardware security module (HSM) integration for production environments that requires enhanced security

//*TODO: Talk about Ceph Storage and Swift Storage nodes, HCI deployments,
//etc.*

The {key_manager} supports HSM integration through the PKCS#11 plugin. This enables:

* Enhanced security for secret storage and retrieval
* Hardware-based key management
* Compliance with security requirements for production environments
* Preservation of existing HSM-protected secrets during adoption

HSM integration is configured through a simple boolean flag (`barbican_hsm_enabled`) during the adoption process. For environments that require HSM integration during adoption, see xref:adopting-key-manager-service-with-proteccio-hsm_{context}[Adopting the {key_manager} with Proteccio HSM integration].
