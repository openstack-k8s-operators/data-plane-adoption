= FIPS support

If you are adopting a {rhos_prev_long} ({OpenStackShort}) {rhos_prev_ver} FIPS environment to {rhos_long} {rhos_curr_ver}, your adopted cluster remains a FIPS cluster. There is no option to change FIPS status during adoption.

There is a major difference with how FIPS was configured in {OpenStackPreviousInstaller} and how it is enabled and enforced in operator deployments. In {OpenStackPreviousInstaller}, FIPS is enabled as part of its configuration, whereas in operator deployments, there is no specific FIPS configuration.

If your cluster is FIPS enabled, you must deploy a FIPS {OpenShift} ({OpenShiftShort}) cluster to adopt your {OpenStackShort} {rhos_prev_ver} FIPS control plane.

For more information about enabling FIPS in {OpenShiftShort}, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/installing/installing-fips.html[Support for FIPS cryptography] in _OpenShift Container Platform Documentation_.
