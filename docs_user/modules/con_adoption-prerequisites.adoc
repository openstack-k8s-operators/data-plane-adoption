= Adoption prerequisites

Before you begin the adoption procedure, complete the following prerequisites:

Planning information::

* Review the xref:adoption-limitations_{context}[Adoption limitations].
* Review the {rhocp_long} requirements, data plane node requirements, Compute node requirements, and so on. For more information, see link:{planning}/index[{planning-t}].
* Review the adoption-specific networking requirements. For more information, see xref:configuring-network-for-RHOSO-deployment_planning[Configuring the network for the RHOSO deployment].
* Review the adoption-specific storage requirements. For more information, see xref:storage-requirements_configuring-network[Storage requirements].
* Review how to customize your deployed control plane with the services that are required for your environment. For more information, see link:{customizing-rhoso}/index[{customizing-rhoso-t}].
ifeval::["{build_variant}" == "ospdo"]
* Familiarize yourself with a disconnected environment deployment. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openstack_platform/17.1/html-single/deploying_an_overcloud_in_a_red_hat_openshift_container_platform_cluster_with_director_operator/index#proc_configuring-an-airgapped-environment_air-gapped-environment[Configuring an airgapped environment] in _Deploying an overcloud in a Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster with director Operator_.
endif::[]
* Familiarize yourself with the following {OpenShiftShort} concepts that are used during adoption:
** link:{defaultOCPURL}/nodes/overview-of-nodes[Overview of nodes]
** link:{defaultOCPURL}/nodes/index#nodes-scheduler-node-selectors-about_nodes-scheduler-node-selectors[About node selectors]
** link:{defaultOCPURL}/machine_configuration/index[Machine configuration overview]
* Make sure to set the correct {rhos_acro} project namespace in which to run commands.
ifeval::["{build_variant}" == "ospdo"]
* In director Operator adoption, the source {rhos_prev_long} {rhos_prev_ver} namespace is `openstack`. In order to successfully adopt the {OpenStackShort} {rhos_prev_ver} environment, the destination {rhos_acro} {rhos_curr_ver} namespace must be different, for example, `rhoso`.

Back-up information::

* Back up your {rhos_prev_long} ({OpenStackShort}) {rhos_prev_ver} environment by using one of the following options:
** The Relax-and-Recover tool. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openstack_platform/17.1/html/backing_up_and_restoring_the_undercloud_and_control_plane_nodes/assembly_backing-up-the-undercloud-and-the-control-plane-nodes-using-the-relax-and-recover-tool_br-undercloud-ctlplane[Backing up the undercloud and the control plane nodes by using the Relax-and-Recover tool] in _Backing up and restoring the undercloud and control plane nodes_.
** The Snapshot and Revert tool. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openstack_platform/17.1/html/backing_up_and_restoring_the_undercloud_and_control_plane_nodes/assembly_snapshot-and-revert-appendix_snapshot-and-revert-appendix[Backing up your Red Hat OpenStack Platform cluster by using the Snapshot and Revert tool] in _Backing up and restoring the undercloud and control plane nodes_.
** A third-party backup and recovery tool. For more information about certified backup and recovery tools, see the link:https://catalog.redhat.com/[Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog].
* Back up the configuration files from the {OpenStackShort} services and {OpenStackPreviousInstaller} on your file system. For more information, see xref:pulling-configuration-from-tripleo-deployment_adopt-control-plane[Pulling the configuration from a {OpenStackPreviousInstaller} deployment].

Compute::

* Upgrade your Compute nodes to Red Hat Enterprise Linux {rhel_prev_ver}. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openstack_platform/17.1/html-single/framework_for_upgrades_16.2_to_17.1/index#upgrading-compute-nodes_upgrading-the-compute-node-operating-system[Upgrading all Compute nodes to RHEL 9.2] in _Framework for upgrades (16.2 to 17.1)_.
* Perform a minor update to the latest {OpenStackShort} version. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openstack_platform/17.1/html/performing_a_minor_update_of_red_hat_openstack_platform/index[Performing a minor update of Red Hat OpenStack Platform].
* Install the `systemd-container` package on your Compute hosts. For more information, see xref:installing-the-systemd-container-package-on-compute-hosts_{context}[Installing the `systemd-container` package on Compute hosts].

ML2/OVS::

* If you use the Modular Layer 2 plug-in with Open vSwitch mechanism driver (ML2/OVS), migrate it to the Modular Layer 2 plug-in with Open Virtual Networking (ML2/OVN) mechanism driver. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openstack_platform/17.1/html/migrating_to_the_ovn_mechanism_driver/index[Migrating to the OVN mechanism driver].

Tools::

* Install the `oc` command line tool on your workstation.
* Install the `podman` command line tool on your workstation.

{OpenStackShort} {rhos_prev_ver} release::

* The {OpenStackShort} {rhos_prev_ver} cloud is updated to the latest minor version of the {rhos_prev_ver} release.

{OpenStackShort} {rhos_prev_ver} hosts::

* All control plane and data plane hosts of the {OpenStackShort} {rhos_prev_ver} cloud are up and running, and continue to run throughout the adoption procedure.
