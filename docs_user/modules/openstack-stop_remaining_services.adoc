= Stopping infrastructure management and Compute services

Before you start the EDPM adoption, make sure that you stop the Compute,
libvirt, load balancing, messaging, and database services on the source cloud. You also need to disable repositories for modular libvirt daemons on Compute hosts.

After this step, the source cloud's control plane can be decomissioned,
which is taking down only cloud controllers, database and messaging nodes.
Nodes that must remain functional are those running the compute, storage,
or networker roles (in terms of composable roles covered by Tripleo Heat
Templates).

== Variables

Define the shell variables used in the steps below.
Define the map of compute node name, IP pairs.
The values are just illustrative and refer to a single node standalone director deployment, use values that are correct for your environment:

----
EDPM_PRIVATEKEY_PATH="~/install_yamls/out/edpm/ansibleee-ssh-key-id_rsa"
declare -A computes
computes=(
  ["standalone.localdomain"]="192.168.122.100"
  # ...
)
----

These ssh variables with the ssh commands are used instead of ansible to try to create instructions that are independent on where they are running. But ansible commands could be used to achieve the same result if you are in the right host, for example to stop a service:

----
. stackrc
ansible -i $(which tripleo-ansible-inventory) Compute -m shell -a "sudo systemctl stop tripleo_virtqemud.service" -b
----

== Stopping remaining services

Remove the conflicting repositories and packages (in case of a devsetup that
uses Standalone TripleO) from all compute hosts. That is required to install
libvirt packages, when these hosts become adopted as External DataPlane Managed
(EDPM) nodes, where modular libvirt daemons are no longer running in podman
containers.

These steps can be automated with a simple script that relies on the previously
defined environmental variables and function:
