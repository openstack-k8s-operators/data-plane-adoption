= Configuring data plane nodes

A complete {rhos_prev_long} ({OpenStackShort}) cluster consists of {rhocp_long} nodes and data plane nodes. The
former use `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` custom resource (CR) to configure physical
interfaces. Since data plane nodes are not {OpenShiftShort} nodes, a different approach to
configure their network connectivity is used.

Instead, data plane nodes are configured by `openstack-operator` and its CRs. The CRs
define desired network configuration for the nodes.

In case of adoption, the configuration should reflect the existing network
setup. You should be able to pull `net_config.yaml` files from each node and
reuse it when defining `OpenstackDataplaneNodeSet`. The format of the
configuration hasn't changed (`os-net-config` is still being used under the
hood), so you should be able to put network templates under
`edpm_network_config_template` variables (either common for all nodes, or
per-node).

To make sure the latest network configuration is used during the data plane adoption, you
should also set `edpm_network_config_update: true` in the `nodeTemplate`.

You will proceed with the data plane adoption once the {OpenShiftShort} control plane is deployed in the
{OpenShiftShort} cluster. When doing so, you will configure `NetConfig` and
`OpenstackDataplaneNodeSet` CRs, using the same VLAN tags and IPAM
configuration as determined in the previous steps.

For example,

```
apiVersion: network.openstack.org/v1beta1
kind: NetConfig
metadata:
  name: netconfig
spec:
  networks:
  - name: internalapi
    dnsDomain: internalapi.example.com
    subnets:
    - name: subnet1
      allocationRanges:
      - end: 172.17.0.250
        start: 172.17.0.100
      cidr: 172.17.0.0/24
      vlan: 20
  - name: storage
    dnsDomain: storage.example.com
    subnets:
    - name: subnet1
      allocationRanges:
      - end: 172.18.0.250
        start: 172.18.0.100
      cidr: 172.18.0.0/24
      vlan: 21
  - name: tenant
    dnsDomain: tenant.example.com
    subnets:
    - name: subnet1
      allocationRanges:
      - end: 172.19.0.250
        start: 172.19.0.100
      cidr: 172.19.0.0/24
      vlan: 22
```

List multiple `allocationRanges` entries to exclude some of the IP addresses,
e.g. to accommodate for addresses already consumed by the adopted environment.

```
apiVersion: network.openstack.org/v1beta1
kind: NetConfig
metadata:
  name: netconfig
spec:
  networks:
  - name: internalapi
    dnsDomain: internalapi.example.com
    subnets:
    - name: subnet1
      allocationRanges:
      - end: 172.17.0.199
        start: 172.17.0.100
      - end: 172.17.0.250
        start: 172.17.0.201
      cidr: 172.17.0.0/24
      vlan: 20
```

The example above would exclude the `172.17.0.200` address from the pool.
