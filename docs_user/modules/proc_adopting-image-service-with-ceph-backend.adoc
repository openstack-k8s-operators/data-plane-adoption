[id="adopting-image-service-with-ceph-backend_{context}"]

= Adopting the {image_service} that is deployed with a {Ceph} back end

Adopt the {image_service_first_ref} that you deployed with a {Ceph} back end. Use the `customServiceConfig` parameter to inject the right configuration to the `GlanceAPI` instance.

.Prerequisites

* You have completed the previous adoption steps.
* Ensure that the Ceph-related secret (`ceph-conf-files`) is created in
the `openstack` namespace and that the `extraMounts` property of the
`OpenStackControlPlane` custom resource (CR) is configured properly. For more information, see xref:configuring-a-ceph-backend_migrating-databases[Configuring a Ceph back end].

<1> If you use IPv6, change the load balancer IP to the load balancer IP in your environment, for example, `metallb.universe.tf/loadBalancerIPs: fd00:bbbb::80`.

[NOTE]
====
If you backed up your {rhos_prev_long} ({OpenStackShort}) services configuration file from the original environment, you can compare it with the confgiuration file that you adopted and ensure that the configuration is correct.
For more information, see xref:pulling-configuration-from-tripleo-deployment_adopt-control-plane[Pulling the configuration from a {OpenStackPreviousInstaller} deployment].

.Procedure

* Patch the `OpenStackControlPlane` CR to deploy the {image_service} with a {Ceph} back end:
