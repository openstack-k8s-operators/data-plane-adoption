= Migrating TLS-e to the {rhos_acro} deployment

If you enabled TLS everywhere (TLS-e) in your {rhos_prev_long} ({OpenStackShort}) {rhos_prev_ver} deployment, you must migrate TLS-e to the {rhos_long} deployment.

The {rhos_acro} deployment uses the cert-manager operator to issue, track, and renew the certificates. In the following procedure, you extract the CA signing certificate from the FreeIPA instance that you use to provide the certificates in the {OpenStackShort} environment, and then import them into cert-manager in the {rhos_acro} environment. As a result, you minimize the disruption on the Compute nodes because you do not need to install a new chain of trust.

You then decommission the previous FreeIPA node and no longer use it to issue certificates. This might not be possible if you use the IPA server to issue certificates for non-{OpenStackShort} systems.

[NOTE]
====
* The following procedure was reproduced on a FreeIPA 4.10.1 server. The location of the files and directories might change depending on the version.

* If the signing keys are stored in an hardware security module (HSM) instead of an NSS shared database (NSSDB), and the keys are retrievable, special HSM utilities might be required.
====

.Prerequisites

* Your {OpenStackShort} deployment is using TLS-e.
* Ensure that the back-end services on the new deployment are not started yet.
* Define the following shell variables. The values are examples and refer to a single-node standalone {OpenStackPreviousInstaller} deployment. Replace these example values with values that are correct for your environment:
+
ifeval::["{build}" != "downstream"]
----
IPA_SSH="ssh -i ~/install_yamls/out/edpm/ansibleee-ssh-key-id_rsa root@192.168.122.100 podman exec -ti freeipa-server-container"
----
+
In this example the FreeIPA instance is running on a separate host, in a container.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{build}" == "downstream"]
----
IPA_SSH="ssh -i <path_to_ssh_key> root@<freeipa-server-ip-address>"
----
endif::[]


.Procedure

ifeval::["{build_variant}" != "ospdo"]
. To locate the CA certificate and key, list all the certificates inside your NSSDB:
+
----
$ IPA_SSH certutil -L -d /etc/pki/pki-tomcat/alias
----
+
* The `-L` option lists all certificates.
* The `-d` option specifies where the certificates are stored.
+
The command produces an output similar to the following example:
+
----
Certificate Nickname                                         Trust Attributes
                                                             SSL,S/MIME,JAR/XPI

caSigningCert cert-pki-ca                                    CTu,Cu,Cu
ocspSigningCert cert-pki-ca                                  u,u,u
Server-Cert cert-pki-ca                                      u,u,u
subsystemCert cert-pki-ca                                    u,u,u
auditSigningCert cert-pki-ca                                 u,u,Pu
----
endif::[]
ifeval::["{build_variant}" == "ospdo"]
. To locate the CA certificate and key, list all the certificates inside your NSSDB. If you installed OSPdO by using director-dev-tools, the server host runs the freeipa server as a container:
+
----
$ IPA_SSH certutil -L -d /etc/pki/pki-tomcat/alias
$ IPA_SSH="podman exec -ti freeipa-server"
----
+
* The `-L` option lists all certificates.
* The `-d` option specifies where the certificates are stored.
+
The command produces an output similar to the following example:
+
----
Certificate Nickname                                         Trust Attributes
                                                             SSL,S/MIME,JAR/XPI

caSigningCert cert-pki-ca                                    CTu,Cu,Cu
ocspSigningCert cert-pki-ca                                  u,u,u
Server-Cert cert-pki-ca                                      u,u,u
subsystemCert cert-pki-ca                                    u,u,u
auditSigningCert cert-pki-ca                                 u,u,Pu
----
endif::[]
. Export the certificate and key from the `/etc/pki/pki-tomcat/alias` directory. The following example uses the `caSigningCert cert-pki-ca` certificate:
+
----
$IPA_SSH pk12util -o /tmp/freeipa.p12 -n 'caSigningCert\ cert-pki-ca' -d /etc/pki/pki-tomcat/alias -k /etc/pki/pki-tomcat/alias/pwdfile.txt -w /etc/pki/pki-tomcat/alias/pwdfile.txt
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The command generates a P12 file with both the certificate and the key. The `/etc/pki/pki-tomcat/alias/pwdfile.txt` file contains the password that protects the key. You can use the password to both extract the key and generate the new file, `/tmp/freeipa.p12`. You can also choose another password. If you choose a different password for the new file, replace the parameter of the `-w` option, or use the `-W` option followed by the password, in clear text.

With that file, you can also get the certificate and the key by using the `openssl pkcs12` command.
====

. Create the secret that contains the root CA:
+
----
$ oc create secret generic rootca-internal
----

. Import the certificate and the key from FreeIPA:
+
----
$ oc patch secret rootca-internal -p="{\"data\":{\"ca.crt\": \"`$IPA_SSH openssl pkcs12 -in /tmp/freeipa.p12 -passin file:/etc/pki/pki-tomcat/alias/pwdfile.txt -nokeys | openssl x509 | base64 -w 0`\"}}"

$ oc patch secret rootca-internal -p="{\"data\":{\"tls.crt\": \"`$IPA_SSH openssl pkcs12 -in /tmp/freeipa.p12 -passin file:/etc/pki/pki-tomcat/alias/pwdfile.txt -nokeys | openssl x509 | base64 -w 0`\"}}"

$ oc patch secret rootca-internal -p="{\"data\":{\"tls.key\": \"`$IPA_SSH openssl pkcs12 -in /tmp/freeipa.p12 -passin file:/etc/pki/pki-tomcat/alias/pwdfile.txt -nocerts -noenc | openssl rsa | base64 -w 0`\"}}"
----

. Create the cert-manager issuer and reference the secret:
+
[source, yaml]
----
$ oc apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: rootca-internal
  labels:
    osp-rootca-issuer-public: ""
    osp-rootca-issuer-internal: ""
    osp-rootca-issuer-libvirt: ""
    osp-rootca-issuer-ovn: ""
spec:
  ca:
    secretName: rootca-internal
EOF
----

. Delete the previously created p12 files:
+
----
$IPA_SSH rm /tmp/freeipa.p12
----

.Verification

* Verify that the necessary resources are created:
+
----
$ oc get issuers
----
+
----
$ oc get secret rootca-internal -o yaml
----

[NOTE]
After the adoption is complete, the cert-manager operator issues new certificates and updates the secrets with the new certificates. As a result, the pods on the control plane automatically restart in order to obtain the new certificates. On the data plane, you must manually initiate a new deployment and restart certain processes to use the new certificates. The old certificates remain active until both the control plane and data plane obtain the new certificates.
