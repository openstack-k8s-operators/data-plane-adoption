= Deploying the {rhos_component_storage_file} on the control plane

Copy the {rhos_component_storage_file_first_ref} configuration from the {rhos_prev_long} ({OpenStackShort}) {rhos_prev_ver} deployment, and then deploy the {rhos_component_storage_file} on the control plane.

.Prerequisites

* The {rhos_component_storage_file} systemd services such as `api`, `cron`, and `scheduler` are stopped. For more information, see xref:stopping-openstack-services_migrating-databases[Stopping {rhos_prev_long} services].
* If the deployment uses CephFS through NFS as a storage back end, the Pacemaker ordering and collocation constraints are adjusted. For more information, see xref:stopping-openstack-services_migrating-databases[Stopping {rhos_prev_long} services].
* The {rhos_component_storage_file} Pacemaker service (`openstack-manila-share`) is stopped. For more information, see xref:stopping-openstack-services_migrating-databases[Stopping {rhos_prev_long} services].
* The database migration is complete. For more information, see xref:migrating-databases-to-mariadb-instances_migrating-databases[Migrating databases to MariaDB instances].
* The {rhocp_long} nodes where the `manila-share` service is to be deployed can reach the management network that the storage system is in.
* If the deployment uses CephFS through NFS as a storage back end, a new clustered Ceph NFS service is deployed on the {CephCluster} cluster with the help
of Ceph orchestrator. For more information, see xref:creating-a-ceph-nfs-cluster_ceph-prerequisites[Creating a Ceph NFS cluster].
* Services such as the {identity_service_first_ref} and memcached are available prior to adopting the Shared File Systems services.
* If you enabled tenant-driven networking by setting `driver_handles_share_servers=True`, the {networking_first_ref} is deployed.
ifeval::["{build}" != "downstream"]
* Define the `CONTROLLER1_SSH` environment variable if it link:stop_openstack_services.md#variables[hasn't been
defined] already. Replace the following example values with values that are correct for your environment:
+
----
$ CONTROLLER1_SSH="ssh -i <path to SSH key> root@<node IP>"
----
+
endif::[]
ifeval::["{build}" != "upstream"]
* The `CONTROLLER1_SSH` environment variable is defined and points to the {OpenStackShort} Controller node. Replace the following example values with values that are correct for your environment:
+
----
$ CONTROLLER1_SSH="ssh -i <path to SSH key> root@<node IP>"
----
+
endif::[]

.Procedure

. Copy the configuration file from {OpenStackShort} {rhos_prev_ver} for reference:
+
----
$ CONTROLLER1_SSH cat /var/lib/config-data/puppet-generated/manila/etc/manila/manila.conf | awk '!/^ *#/ && NF' > ~/manila.conf
----

. Review the configuration file for configuration changes that were made since {OpenStackShort} {rhos_prev_ver}. For more information on preparing this file for {rhos_long}, see xref:preparing-the-shared-file-systems-service-configuration_adopting-shared-file-systems[Guidelines for preparing the {rhos_component_storage_file} configuration].
// - TODO link config diff tables for RHOSP 17.1 (Wallaby) to RHOSP 18 (Antelope) -

. Create a patch file for the `OpenStackControlPlane` CR to deploy the {rhos_component_storage_file}. The following example `manila.patch` file uses native CephFS:

<1> If you use IPv6, change the load balancer IP to the load balancer IP in your environment, for example, `metallb.universe.tf/loadBalancerIPs: fd00:bbbb::80`.
<2> Ensure that the names of the back ends (`share_backend_name`) are the same as they were in {OpenStackShort} {rhos_prev_ver}.
<3> Ensure that you specify the appropriate storage management network in the `networkAttachments` section. For example, the `manilaShares` instance with the CephFS back-end driver is connected to the `storage` network.
<4> If you need to add extra files to any of the services, you can use `extraMounts`. For example, when using {Ceph}, you can add the {rhos_component_storage_file} Ceph user's keyring file as well as the `ceph.conf` configuration file.

* Prior to adopting the `manilaShares` service for CephFS through NFS, ensure that you create a clustered Ceph NFS service. The name of the service must be `cephfs_nfs_cluster_id`. The `cephfs_nfs_cluster_id` option is set with the name of the NFS cluster created on {Ceph}.
* The `cephfs_ganesha_server_ip` option is preserved from the configuration on the {OpenStackShort} {rhos_prev_ver} environment.

. Patch the `OpenStackControlPlane` CR:
+
----
$ oc patch openstackcontrolplane openstack --type=merge --patch-file=~/<manila.patch>
----
+
* Replace `<manila.patch>` with the name of your patch file.

.Verification

. Inspect the resulting {rhos_component_storage_file} pods:
+
----
$ oc get pods -l service=manila
----

. Check that the Shared File Systems API service is registered in the {identity_service_first_ref}:
+
----
$ openstack service list | grep manila
----
+
----
$ openstack endpoint list | grep manila

. Test the health of the service:
+
----
$ openstack share service list
$ openstack share pool list --detail
----

. Check existing workloads:
+
----
$ openstack share list
$ openstack share snapshot list
----
ifeval::["{build}" != "downstream"]
. You can create further resources:
+
----
$ openstack share create cephfs 10 --snapshot mysharesnap --name myshareclone
$ openstack share create nfs 10 --name mynfsshare
$ openstack share export location list mynfsshare
