= {block_storage} guidelines

Prepare to adopt your {block_storage_first_ref}:

* Take note of the {block_storage} back ends that you use.
* Determine all the transport protocols that the {block_storage} back ends use, such as
RBD, iSCSI, FC, NFS, NVMe-TCP, and so on. You must consider them when you place the Block Storage services and when the right storage transport-related binaries are running on the {rhocp_long} nodes. For more information about each storage transport protocol, see xref:openshift-preparation-for-block-storage-adoption_storage-requirements[{OpenShiftShort} preparation for {block_storage} adoption].
* Use a {block_storage} volume service to deploy each {block_storage} volume back end.
+
For example, you have an LVM back end, a Ceph back end, and two entries in `cinderVolumes`, and you cannot set global defaults for all volume services. You must define a service for each of them:

[WARNING]
Check that all configuration options are still valid for {rhos_acro} {rhos_curr_ver} version. Configuration options might be deprecated, removed, or added. This applies to both back-end driver-specific configuration options and other generic options.

ifeval::["{build}" != "downstream"]
There are two ways to prepare a {block_storage} configuration for adoption. You can customize the configuration or prepare a quick configuration. There is no difference in how {block_storage} operates with both methods, but you should customize the configuration whenever possible.
