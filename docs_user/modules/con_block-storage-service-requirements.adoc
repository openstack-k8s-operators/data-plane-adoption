= Block Storage service requirements

The Block Storage service (cinder) has both local storage used by the service and OpenStack user requirements.

Local storage is used for example when downloading a glance image for the create volume from image operation, which can become considerable when having
concurrent operations and not using the Block Storage service volume cache.

In the Operator deployed OpenStack, there is a way to configure the
location of the conversion directory to be an NFS share (using the extra
volumes feature), something that needed to be done manually before.

Even if it's an adoption and it may seem that there's nothing to consider
regarding the Block Storage service backends, because you are using the same ones that you are
using in your current deployment, you should still evaluate it, because it may not be so straightforward.

First you need to check the transport protocol the Block Storage service backends are using:
RBD, iSCSI, FC, NFS, NVMe-oF, etc.

Once you know all the transport protocols that you are using, you can make
sure that you are taking them into consideration when placing the Block Storage services (as mentioned above in the Node Roles section) and the right storage transport related binaries are running on the OpenShift nodes.

Detailed information about the specifics for each storage transport protocol can be found in the xref:adopting-the-block-storage-service_{context}[Adopting the Block Storage service].
