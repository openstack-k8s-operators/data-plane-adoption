= Migrating {Ceph} MDS to new nodes within the existing cluster

In the context of data plane adoption, where the {rhos_prev_long} ({OpenStackShort}) services are
redeployed in {OpenShift}, a {OpenStackPreviousInstaller}-deployed {CephCluster} cluster will undergo a migration in a process we are calling “externalizing” the {CephCluster} cluster.
There are two deployment topologies, broadly, that include an “internal” {CephCluster} cluster today: one is where {OpenStackShort} includes dedicated {CephCluster} nodes to host object storage daemons (OSDs), and the other is Hyperconverged Infrastructure (HCI) where Compute nodes double up as {CephCluster} nodes. In either scenario, there are some {Ceph} processes that are deployed on {OpenStackShort} Controller nodes: {Ceph} monitors, Ceph Object Gateway (RGW), Rados Block Device (RBD), Ceph Metadata Server (MDS), Ceph Dashboard, and NFS Ganesha.
This document describes how to migrate the MDS daemon in case {rhos_component_storage_file_first_ref} (deployed with either a cephfs-native or ceph-nfs backend) is part of the overcloud deployment. The MDS migration is performed by cephadm, and as done for the other daemons, the general idea is to move the daemons placement from a "hosts" based approach to a "label" based one. 
ifeval::["{build}" != "upstream"]
This ensures that the human operator can easily visualize the status of the cluster and where daemons are placed using the `ceph orch host` command, and have a general view of how the daemons are co-located within a given host, according to the https://access.redhat.com/articles/1548993[cardinality matrix].

//kgilliga: Note to self/SMEs: This intro will be rewritten for GA, so the text might not flow very well right now.

For this procedure, we assume that we are beginning with a {OpenStackShort} based on {rhos_prev_ver} and a {Ceph} {CephRelease} deployment managed by {OpenStackPreviousInstaller}.
We assume that:

* {Ceph} is upgraded to {Ceph} {CephRelease} and is managed by cephadm/orchestrator.
* Both the {Ceph} public and cluster networks are propagated, through{OpenStackPreviousInstaller}, to the target nodes.

.Prerequisites

* Verify that the {CephCluster} cluster is healthy and check the MDS status:

* Check the OSD blocklist and clean up the client list:

----

     ceph osd blocklist rm $item;

----

[NOTE]
When a file system client is unresponsive or misbehaving, it may happen that
the access to the file system is forcibly terminated. This process is called
eviction. Evicting a CephFS client prevents it from communicating further with MDS daemons and OSD daemons.
Ordinarily, a blocklisted client may not reconnect to the servers: it must be unmounted and then remounted. However, in some situations it may be useful to permit a client that was evicted to attempt to reconnect. Because CephFS uses the RADOS OSD blocklist to control client eviction, CephFS clients can be permitted to reconnect by removing them from the blocklist.

.Procedure

. Get the hosts that are currently part of the {Ceph} cluster:
+
----
[ceph: root@controller-0 /]# ceph orch host ls
HOST                        ADDR           LABELS          STATUS
cephstorage-0.redhat.local  192.168.24.25  osd mds
cephstorage-1.redhat.local  192.168.24.50  osd mds
cephstorage-2.redhat.local  192.168.24.47  osd mds
controller-0.redhat.local   192.168.24.24  _admin mgr mon
controller-1.redhat.local   192.168.24.42  mgr _admin mon
controller-2.redhat.local   192.168.24.37  mgr _admin mon
6 hosts in cluster

[ceph: root@controller-0 /]# ceph orch ls --export mds
service_type: mds
service_id: mds
service_name: mds.mds
placement:
  hosts:
  - controller-0.redhat.local
  - controller-1.redhat.local
  - controller-2.redhat.local
----

. Extend the MDS labels to the target nodes:
+
----
for item in $(sudo cephadm shell --  ceph orch host ls --format json | jq -r '.[].hostname'); do
    sudo cephadm shell -- ceph orch host label add  $item mds;
done
----

. Verify all the hosts have the MDS label:
+
----
[tripleo-admin@controller-0 ~]$ sudo cephadm shell -- ceph orch host ls

HOST                    	ADDR       	   LABELS
cephstorage-0.redhat.local  192.168.24.11  osd mds
cephstorage-1.redhat.local  192.168.24.12  osd mds
cephstorage-2.redhat.local  192.168.24.47  osd mds
controller-0.redhat.local   192.168.24.35  _admin mon mgr mds
controller-1.redhat.local   192.168.24.53  mon _admin mgr mds
controller-2.redhat.local   192.168.24.10  mon _admin mgr mds
----

. Dump the current MDS spec:
+
----
[ceph: root@controller-0 /]# ceph orch ls --export mds > mds.yaml
----

. Edit the retrieved spec and replace the `placement.hosts` section with
`placement.label`:
+
----
service_type: mds
service_id: mds
service_name: mds.mds
placement:
  label: mds
----

. Use the `ceph orchestrator` to apply the new MDS spec: it results in an
increased number of mds daemons:
+
----
$ sudo cephadm shell -m mds.yaml -- ceph orch apply -i /mnt/mds.yaml
Scheduling new mds deployment …
----

. Check the new standby daemons temporarily added to the cephfs fs:

. To migrate MDS to the right nodes, set the MDS affinity that manages the MDS failover: 
ifeval::["{build}" != "downstream"]
[NOTE]
It is possible to elect as "active" a dedicated MDS for a particular file system. To configure this preference, `CephFS` provides a configuration option for MDS called `mds_join_fs` which enforces this affinity.
When failing over MDS daemons, a cluster’s monitors will prefer standby daemons with `mds_join_fs` equal to the file system name with the failed rank. If no standby exists with `mds_join_fs` equal to the file system name, it will choose an unqualified standby as a replacement.
//kgilliga: We might want to discuss what info is really necessary downstream.
endif::[]
+
----
ceph config set mds.mds.cephstorage-0.fqcshx mds_join_fs cephfs
----

. Remove the labels from Controller nodes and force the MDS failover to the
target node:
+
----
$ for i in 0 1 2; do ceph orch host label rm "controller-$i.redhat.local" mds; done

Removed label mds from host controller-0.redhat.local
Removed label mds from host controller-1.redhat.local
Removed label mds from host controller-2.redhat.local
----
+
The switch happens behind the scenes, and the new active MDS is the one that
you set through the `mds_join_fs` command.

. Check the result of the failover and the new deployed daemons:
