= Configuring isolated networks on {OpenShiftShort} worker nodes

To connect service pods to isolated networks on {rhocp_long} worker nodes that run {rhos_prev_long} services, physical network configuration on the hypervisor is required.

This configuration is managed by the NMState operator, which uses `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` custom resources (CRs) to define the desired network configuration for the nodes.

.Procedure

* For each {OpenShiftShort} worker node, define a `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` CR that describes the desired network configuration. For example:

[WARNING]
In IPv6, {rhocp_long} worker nodes need a `/64` prefix allocation due to OVN
limitations (RFC 4291). For dynamic IPv6 configuration, you need to change the
prefix allocation on the Router Advertisement settings. If you want to use
manual configuration for IPv6, define a similar CR to the
`NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` CR example in this procedure, and define an
IPv6 address and disable IPv4. Because the constraint for the `/64` prefix did
not exist in {OpenstackPreviousInstaller}, your {OpenStackShort}
control plane network might not have enough capacity to allocate these
networks. If that is the case, allocate a prefix that fits a large enough number
of addresses, for example, `/60`. The prefix depends on the number of worker nodes you have.
