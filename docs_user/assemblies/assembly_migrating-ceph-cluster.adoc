= Migrating the {CephCluster} Cluster

:context: migrating-ceph

In the context of data plane adoption, where the {rhos_prev_long}
({OpenStackShort}) services are redeployed in {rhocp_long}, you migrate a
{OpenStackPreviousInstaller}-deployed {CephCluster} cluster by using a process
called “externalizing” the {CephCluster} cluster.

There are two deployment topologies that include an internal {CephCluster}
cluster:

* {OpenStackShort} includes dedicated {CephCluster} nodes to host object
  storage daemons (OSDs)

* Hyperconverged Infrastructure (HCI), where Compute and Storage services are
  colocated on hyperconverged nodes

In either scenario, there are some {Ceph} processes that are deployed on
{OpenStackShort} Controller nodes: {Ceph} monitors, Ceph Object Gateway (RGW),
Rados Block Device (RBD), Ceph Metadata Server (MDS), Ceph Dashboard, and NFS
Ganesha. To migrate your {CephCluster} cluster, you must decommission the
Controller nodes and move the {Ceph} daemons to a set of target nodes that are
already part of the {CephCluster} cluster.
