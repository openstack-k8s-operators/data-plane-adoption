= Adopting Distributed Compute Node deployments

[role="_abstract"]
Distributed Compute Node (DCN) deployments extend {rhos_prev_long} ({OpenStackShort}) to multiple geographic sites while maintaining a centralized control plane. When adopting a DCN deployment to {rhos_long}, you must account for the multi-site network topology and create separate data plane nodesets for each site.

This section covers the additional considerations and procedures required to adopt DCN deployments, including:

* Understanding the differences between standard and DCN adoption
* Configuring spine-leaf network topologies with routed provider networks
* Creating site-specific data plane nodesets with appropriate network configurations

[NOTE]
====
The control plane adoption process for DCN deployments is identical to standard adoption. The differences described in this section apply to network configuration and data plane adoption.
