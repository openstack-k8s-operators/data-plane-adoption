= {rhos_long_noacro} {rhos_curr_ver} adoption overview

Adoption is the process of migrating a {rhos_prev_long} ({OpenStackShort}) {rhos_prev_ver} control plane to {rhos_long_noacro} {rhos_curr_ver}, and then completing an in-place upgrade of the data plane. Adoption enables you to retain existing infrastructure investments while modernizing your {OpenStackShort} deployment on a containerized {rhocp_long} foundation. To ensure that you understand the entire adoption process and how to sufficiently prepare your {OpenStackShort} environment, review the prerequisites, adoption process, and post-adoption tasks.

[IMPORTANT]
It is important to read the whole adoption guide before you start
the adoption to ensure that you understand the procedure. You also must prepare the necessary configuration snippets for each {OpenStackShort} service in advance, and test the migration in a representative test environment before you apply it to production.
