= Migrating the monitoring stack to the target nodes

The migration procedure relies on nodes re-labeling: this kind of action,
combined with an update in the existing spec, results in the daemons'
relocation on the target nodes.

Before start this process, a few considerations are required:

* There’s no need to migrate node exporters: these daemons are deployed across
the nodes that are part of the {CephCluster} cluster (placement is ‘*’), and  we’re going to lose metrics as long as the Controller nodes are not part of the {CephCluster} cluster anymore
* Each monitoring stack component is bound to specific ports that TripleO is
supposed to open beforehand; make sure to double check the firewall rules are
in place and the ports are opened for a given monitoring stack service

Depending on the target nodes and the number of deployed/active daemons, it is
possible to either relocate the existing containers to the target nodes, or
select a subset of nodes that are supposed to host the monitoring stack
daemons. As we mentioned in the previous section, HA is not supported, hence
reducing the placement with `count: 1` is a reasonable solution and allows to
successfully migrate the existing daemons in an HCI (or HW limited) scenario
without impacting other services.
However, it is still possible to put in place a dedicated HA solution and
realize a component that is consistent with the TripleO model to reach HA.
Building and deployment such HA model is out of scope for this procedure.
