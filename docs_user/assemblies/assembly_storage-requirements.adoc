= Storage requirements

When looking into the storage in an OpenStack deployment you can differentiate
2 different kinds, the storage requirements of the services themselves and the
storage used for the OpenStack users that the services will manage.

These requirements may drive your OpenShift node selection, as mentioned above,
and may require you to do some preparations on the OpenShift nodes before
you can deploy the services.
