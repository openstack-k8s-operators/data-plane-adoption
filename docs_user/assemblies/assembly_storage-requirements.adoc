= Storage requirements

[role="_abstract"]
Storage in a {rhos_prev_long} ({OpenStackShort}) deployment refers to the following types:

* The storage that is needed for the service to run
* The storage that the service manages

Before you can deploy the services in {rhos_long}, you must review the storage requirements, plan your {rhocp_long} node selection, prepare your {OpenShiftShort} nodes, and so on.

//*TODO: Galera, RabbitMQ, Swift, Glance, etc.*
