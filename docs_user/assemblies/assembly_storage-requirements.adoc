= Storage requirements

When looking into the storage in an {rhos_prev_long} ({OpenStackShort}) deployment you can differentiate
two kinds, the storage requirements of the services themselves and the
storage used for the {OpenStackShort} users that the services will manage.

These requirements may drive your {OpenShift} ({OpenShiftShort}) node selection, as mentioned above,
and may require you to do some preparations on the {OpenShiftShort} nodes before
you can deploy the services.
