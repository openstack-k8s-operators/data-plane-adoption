= Migrating the monitoring stack component to new nodes within an existing {Ceph} cluster 

In the context of data plane adoption, where the {rhos_prev_long} ({OpenStackShort}) services are
redeployed in {OpenShift}, a {OpenStackPreviousInstaller}-deployed {CephCluster} cluster will undergo a migration in a process we are calling “externalizing” the {CephCluster} cluster.
There are two deployment topologies, broadly, that include an “internal” {CephCluster} cluster today: one is where {OpenStackShort} includes dedicated {CephCluster} nodes to host object storage daemons (OSDs), and the other is Hyperconverged Infrastructure (HCI) where Compute nodes
double up as {CephCluster} nodes. In either scenario, there are some {Ceph} processes that are deployed on {OpenStackShort} Controller nodes: {Ceph} monitors, Ceph Object Gateway (RGW), Rados Block Device (RBD), Ceph Metadata Server (MDS), Ceph Dashboard, and NFS Ganesha.
The Ceph Dashboard module adds web-based monitoring and administration to the
Ceph Manager.
With {OpenStackPreviousInstaller}-deployed {Ceph} this component is enabled as part of the overcloud deploy and it’s composed by:

- Ceph Manager module
- Grafana
- Prometheus
- Alertmanager
- Node exporter

The Ceph Dashboard containers are included through `tripleo-container-image-prepare` parameters and the high availability relies on `Haproxy` and `Pacemaker` deployed on the {OpenStackShort} front.
For an external {CephCluster} cluster, high availability is not supported.
The goal of this procedure is to migrate and relocate the Ceph Monitoring
components to free Controller nodes.

For this procedure, we assume that we are beginning with a {OpenStackShort} based on {rhos_prev_ver} and a {Ceph} {CephRelease} deployment managed by {OpenStackPreviousInstaller}.
We assume that:

* {Ceph} has been upgraded to {CephRelease} and is managed by cephadm/orchestrator
* Both the {Ceph} public and cluster networks are propagated, through{OpenStackPreviousInstaller}, to the target nodes
