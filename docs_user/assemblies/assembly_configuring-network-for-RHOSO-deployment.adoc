= Configuring the network for the {rhos_long_noacro} deployment

When you adopt a new {rhos_long} deployment, you must align the network
configuration with the adopted cluster to maintain connectivity for existing
workloads.

Perform the following tasks to incorporate the existing network configuration:

* Configure {rhocp_long} worker nodes to align VLAN tags and IP Address Management (IPAM) configuration with the existing deployment.
* Configure control plane services to use compatible IP ranges for service and load-balancing IP addresses.
* Configure data plane nodes to use corresponding compatible configuration for VLAN tags and IPAM.

When configuring nodes and services, the general approach is as follows:

* For IPAM, you can either reuse subnet ranges from the existing deployment or, if there is a shortage of free IP addresses in existing subnets, define new ranges for the new control plane services. If you define new ranges, you configure IP routing between the old and new ranges. For more information, see xref:planning-your-ipam-configuration_configuring-network[Planning your IPAM configuration].
* For VLAN tags, always reuse the configuration from the existing deployment.
