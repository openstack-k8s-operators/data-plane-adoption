= {Ceph} prerequisites

Before you migrate your {Ceph} cluster daemons from your Controller nodes, complete the following tasks in your {rhos_prev_long} {rhos_prev_ver} environment:

* Upgrade your {Ceph} cluster to release {CephVernum}. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openstack_platform/17.1/html-single/framework_for_upgrades_16.2_to_17.1/index#assembly_ceph-6-to-7_upgrade_post-upgrade-external-ceph[Upgrading Red Hat Ceph Storage 6 to 7] in _Framework for upgrades (16.2 to 17.1)_.
* Your {Ceph} {CephVernum} deployment is managed by `cephadm`.
* The undercloud is still available, and the nodes and networks are managed by {OpenStackPreviousInstaller}.
* If you use an externally deployed {Ceph} cluster, you must recreate a `ceph-nfs` cluster in the target nodes as well as propogate the `StorageNFS` network.

Complete the prerequisites for your specific {Ceph} environment:
