= Migrating Red Hat Ceph Storage RBD to external RHEL nodes

:context: migrating-ceph-rbd

For Hyperconverged Infrastructure (HCI) or dedicated Storage nodes that are
running {Ceph} {CephVernum} or later, you must migrate the daemons that are
included in the {rhos_prev_long} control plane into the existing external Red
Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) nodes. The external RHEL nodes typically include
the Compute nodes for an HCI environment or dedicated storage nodes.

.Prerequisites

* Complete the tasks in your {rhos_prev_long} {rhos_prev_ver} environment. For more information, see xref:red-hat-ceph-storage-prerequisites_configuring-network[{Ceph} prerequisites].
