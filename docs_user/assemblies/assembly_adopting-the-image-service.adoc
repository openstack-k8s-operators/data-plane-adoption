= Adopting the {image_service}

To adopt the {image_service_first_ref} you patch an existing `OpenStackControlPlane` custom resource (CR) that has the {image_service} disabled. The patch starts the service with the configuration parameters that are provided by the {rhos_prev_long} ({OpenStackShort}) environment.

The {image_service} adoption is complete if you see the following results:

* The `GlanceAPI` service up and running.
* The {identity_service} endpoints are updated, and the same back end of the source cloud is available.

To complete the {image_service} adoption, ensure that your environment meets the following criteria:

* You have a running {OpenStackPreviousInstaller} environment (the source cloud).
* You have a Single Node OpenShift or OpenShift Local that is running in the {rhocp_long} cluster.
* Optional: You can reach an internal/external `Ceph` cluster by both `crc` and {OpenStackPreviousInstaller}.
