= Adopting the {key_manager} with Hardware Security Module integration

This assembly describes how to adopt the {key_manager_first_ref} from {OpenStackPreviousInstaller} to {rhos_long} when your source environment includes Hardware Security Module (HSM) integration.

Hardware Security Modules provide enhanced security for cryptographic operations by storing encryption keys in dedicated hardware devices. When migrating from {OpenStackPreviousInstaller} to {rhos_acro}, it is essential to preserve HSM functionality and maintain access to HSM-backed secrets.
