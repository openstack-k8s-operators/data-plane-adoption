= Migrating Ceph Monitor daemons to {Ceph} nodes

:context: migrating-ceph-mon

You must move Ceph Monitor daemons from the {rhos_prev_long} ({OpenStackShort}) Controller nodes to a set of target nodes. Target nodes are either existing {Ceph} nodes, or {OpenStackShort} Compute nodes if {Ceph} is
deployed by {OpenStackPreviousInstaller} with a Hyperconverged Infrastructure (HCI) topology. Additional Ceph Monitors are deployed to the target nodes, and they are promoted as `_admin` nodes that you can use to manage the {CephCluster} cluster and perform day 2 operations.

To migrate the Ceph Monitor daemons, you must perform the following high-level steps:

. xref:configuring-target-nodes-for-ceph-monitor-migration_{context}[Configure the target nodes for Ceph Monitor migration].
. xref:draining-the-source-node_{context}[Drain the source node].
. xref:migrating-the-ceph-monitor-ip-address_{context}[Migrate your Ceph Monitor IP addresses to the target nodes].
. xref:redeploying-a-ceph-monitor-on-the-target-node_{context}[Redeploy the Ceph Monitor on the target node].
. xref:verifying-the-cluster-after-ceph-mon-migration_{context}[Verify that the {Cephcluster} cluster is healthy].

Repeat these steps for any additional Controller node that hosts a Ceph Monitor until you migrate all the Ceph Monitor daemons to the target nodes.
