= Planning the new deployment

Just like you did back when you installed your director-deployed {rhos_prev_long}, the
upgrade/migration to the control plane requires planning various aspects
of the environment such as node roles, planning your network topology, and
storage.

This document covers some of this planning, but it is recommended to read
the whole adoption guide before actually starting the process to be sure that
there is a global understanding of the whole process.
