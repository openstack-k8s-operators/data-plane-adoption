:context: planning

= Planning the new deployment

Just like you did back when you installed your {OpenStackPreviousInstaller}-deployed {rhos_prev_long}, the
upgrade/migration to the control plane requires planning various aspects
of the environment such as node roles, planning your network topology, and
storage.

[IMPORTANT]
This section contains considerations for adoption planning, but it is
important to read the whole adoption guide before actually starting
the process. You should form an understanding of the procedure,
prepare the necessary configuration snippets for each service ahead of
time, and test the procedure in a representative test environment
before adopting your main environment.
